### Why Set Up Minikube?

Before we begin, you might be wondering why it‚Äôs essential to set up Minikube. Well, Minikube provides an excellent environment for learning and experimenting with Kubernetes without the need for a full-scale cluster. It‚Äôs perfect for developers and enthusiasts who want to get hands-on experience with Kubernetes in a controlled environment.

### Prerequisites

To follow along with this tutorial, you‚Äôll need the following:

* An AWS account (if you‚Äôre setting up on an AWS instance).
    
* Basic knowledge of AWS and Linux terminal commands.
    

Let‚Äôs get started!

### Setting Up Minikube on AWS¬†Instance

Here, I am creating an EC2 Instance to set up minikube on the server. If you are comfortable setting up minikube on your local then feel free to jump on the minikube setup.

*Enter the name of the machine and select the Ubuntu22.04 AMI Image.*

Select t2medium along with 2 CPU core.

Create a new key pair.

Open Port 22 and rest leaf it.

Now, go to your Downloads folder or where you have downloaded your pem file and change the permission by running the command ‚Äòchmod 400 &lt;Pem\_file\_name&gt;

Now, connect your instance by copying the given command below.

Now, run the following commands to install Minikube on your local machine or AWS machine.

```plaintext
sudo apt update -y && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo reboot
```

After 3 to 4 minutes, reconnect with the instance through ssh

```plaintext
sudo apt install docker.io
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER && newgrp docker
sudo apt install -y curl wget apt-transport-https
curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/minikube-linux-amd64
sudo install minikube-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/minikube
minikube version
```

```plaintext
curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/`curl -s https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/stable.txt`/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl
```

```plaintext
chmod +x kubectl
sudo mv kubectl /usr/local/bin
kubectl version -o yaml
minikube start - vm-driver=docker
```

Now, to verify the installation you can run the given command and if you get the result in the snippet then your installation is completed.

```plaintext
minikube status
```

You can also validate your kubectl version by running the command.

```plaintext
kubectl version
```

Now, run the given command after 4 to 5 minutes which will show the nodes.

```plaintext
kubectl get nodes
```

### Creating Your First¬†Pod

```plaintext
vim test.yml
```

```plaintext
kind: Pod                              
apiVersion: v1                     
metadata:                           
  name: testpod                  
spec:                                    
  containers:                      
    - name: c00                     
      image: ubuntu              
      command: ["/bin/bash", "-c", "while true; do echo Hello-Kubernetes; sleep 5 ; done"]
    - name: container2
      image: ubuntu
      command: ["/bin/bash", "-c", "while true; do echo Second Container is still running; sleep 3 ; done"]
  restartPolicy: Never
```

Deploying the pod

```plaintext
kubectl apply -f test.yml
```

List the Pods

```plaintext
kubectl get pods
```

**Check Logs:**

```plaintext
kubectl logs -f pod1
```

To check the logs of the primary container, specify the container name:

```plaintext
kubectl logs -f pod1 -c container1
```

To check the logs of the second container, specify the container name:

```plaintext
kubectl logs -f pod1 -c container2
```

**Delete the Pod:**

```plaintext
kubectl delete pod pod1
```

To list the IP of the pod, use the below command.

```plaintext
kubectl pod pod1 -c container1 ‚Äî hostname -i
```

To delete the pod by specifying the manifest file name

```plaintext
kubectl delete -f test.yml
```

### KubeConfig Files

#### 1\. Kubeconfig Files:

**Purpose:** Think of a kubeconfig file as your passport to the Kubernetes kingdom. It contains all the authentication information you need to interact with the cluster, including cluster details, user credentials, certificates, and context.

**Content:** This YAML file stores information like the API server address, your username and token, and the specific context you‚Äôre using to access the cluster.

**Usage:** Your `kubectl` command-line tool relies on the kubeconfig file to identify the target cluster and establish a secure connection. You can store it in the default location (~/.kube/config) or specify its path using the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable.

```plaintext
apiVersion: v1
kind: Config
clusters:
- name: my-cluster
  cluster:
    server: https://api.example.com
    certificate-authority-data: <ca-data>
users:
- name: my-user
  user:
    client-certificate-data: <client-cert-data>
    client-key-data: <client-key-data>
contexts:
- name: my-context
  context:
    cluster: my-cluster
    user: my-user
    namespace: my-namespace
current-context: my-context
```

In this example,

* **apiVersion** and **kind** define the resource type.
    
* **clusters** specifies the clusters with its server and URL and Certificate Authority(CA) data. Here we have to define the server link or Kubernetes API Server of the Kubernetes cluster. So, when we run any command using kubectl then kubectl interacts with the given link or Kubernetes API Server of the Kubernetes cluster.
    
* **users** specify the users with their client certificate and client key name. So, only authorized users can access the Kubernetes cluster.
    
* **contexts** specify the cluster, user, and namespace information that has been defined above. You can create multiple contexts and switch between any different clusters at any time.
    
* **current-context** specifies that on which cluster the command should run. If you set the current-context one time then you won‚Äôt have to specify again and again while running the commands.
    

#### 2\. Services:

**Purpose**: Services act as your application‚Äôs public face within the Kubernetes landscape. They provide a stable access point for pods belonging to your deployment, handling load balancing and network routing.

Content: Service files specify details like the service name, type (e.g., LoadBalancer, NodePort), and selector that identifies the pods it should route traffic to.

Usage: Developers use services to expose their applications internally within the cluster or externally to the outside world. This allows independent scaling of pods without changing how users access the application.

```plaintext
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-app-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: my-app
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 80
    targetPort: 8080
```

#### 3\. Deployments:

**Purpose:** Deployments act as your automated deployment managers, controlling the desired state of your application within the cluster. They manage pod replicas, update strategies, and roll out new versions of your application.

**Content:** Deployment files define parameters like the number of replicas, container image and resources, pod template with environment variables, and update strategy (e.g., rolling update).

**Usage:** Developers use deployments to automate the process of deploying, scaling, and updating their applications in a controlled and predictable manner. This ensures seamless rollouts and minimizes downtime during updates.

```plaintext
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: my-app-container
        image: my-app-image:latest
```
